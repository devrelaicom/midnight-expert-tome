# UserPromptSubmit hook: drain entries from ~/.midnight-expert/settings.local.json's
# top-level `on_next_user_prompt` array and surface them to Claude as
# additional context for this turn. Each entry is an object with a `type`
# discriminator; this hook formats known types and silently skips unknown
# ones (forward-compat).
#
# Producers (currently: compact-core's Stop hook) append/replace entries
# during a session; this hook removes them on the very next user prompt so
# they appear exactly once.
#
# This script must NEVER block prompt submission: any failure path falls
# through to a clean `exit 0`.
