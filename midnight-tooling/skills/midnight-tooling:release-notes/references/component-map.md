### Resolving "wallet" Ambiguity

- If context suggests backend/service → `wallet`
- If context suggests API/programmatic access → `midnight-wallet-api`
- If context suggests browser extension → `lace`
- If unclear → ask the user which component they mean

## Stale Components

| Component | Last Standalone Version | Last Release Date | Superseded By |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| proof-server | 4.0.0 | 12 May 2025 | Ledger |
| onchain-runtime | 4.0.0 | 12 May 2025 | Ledger |

Both are now developed within the Ledger repository ([midnightntwrk/midnight-ledger](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-ledger)). Their independent release notes have not been updated since version 4.0.0.

**Note:** The Docker image `midnightntwrk/proof-server` is still actively published and used — both as a standalone container and as part of the local devnet. The "stale" designation here applies only to independent release notes, not to the proof server software itself. For current proof server versions, check the Ledger release notes or the Docker Hub tags.

When displaying Ledger release notes as a substitute, include a note such as:

> **Note**: The proof-server is now part of Ledger. The last standalone proof-server release was 4.0.0 (12 May 2025). Showing Ledger release notes instead. If you want the standalone proof-server release notes, let me know.

## Version File Naming

| Component | Example Filename | Extracted Version |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| compact-tools | `compact-tools-0-4-0.mdx` | 0.4.0 |
| ledger | `ledger-7-0-0.mdx` | 7.0.0 |
| lace | `lace-3-0-0.mdx` | 3.0.0 |
| lace (RC) | `lace-1-0-0-RC1.mdx` | 1.0.0-RC1 |
| wallet | `wallet-5-0-0.mdx` | 5.0.0 |
| compact | `compact-0-20-28-0.mdx` | Check `title` in frontmatter |
| compact (special) | `minokawa-0-18-26-0.mdx` | Check `title` in frontmatter. "Minokawa" is a historical codename used in early Compact compiler release note filenames. |

### Extraction Rules

1. Strip the component prefix and `.mdx` extension
2. Replace dashes with dots for the remaining segments
3. If the result contains `-RC`, treat it as a pre-release suffix
4. For the Compact compiler, the filename may contain compound version segments — always verify against the `title` field in the YAML frontmatter

### Sorting Versions

Sort versions using semver ordering (major, then minor, then patch). RC versions sort below their corresponding release (e.g., `1.0.0-RC1 < 1.0.0`). When determining the "latest" version, exclude RC versions unless no stable release exists.
